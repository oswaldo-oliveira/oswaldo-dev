# Hello!! I'm Oswaldo Oliveira!!

I bring 𝟐+ 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐬 of experience 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 and 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 to power the agility and efficiency of large 𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 companies like 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚/𝐕𝐢𝐯𝐨 (one of the largest telecommunications companies in Latin America). Whether transforming 𝐒𝐎𝐀𝐏 services into 𝐑𝐄𝐒𝐓 𝐀𝐏𝐈𝐬 or developing new ones with 𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞.𝐣𝐬, 𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐉𝐒, 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐭, my passion lies in crafting reliable and scalable 𝐦𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐬.

My technical toolbox is diverse, encompassing 𝐉𝐚𝐯𝐚, 𝐒𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐭, 𝐍𝐨𝐝𝐞.𝐣𝐬, 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐢𝐩𝐭, 𝐍𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐉𝐒, 𝐂𝐈/𝐂𝐃 𝐩𝐢𝐩𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬, and 𝐭𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐢𝐞𝐬. This allows me to deliver 𝐡𝐢𝐠𝐡-𝐪𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲 code that adheres to best practices and integrates seamlessly with existing systems.

Beyond technical prowess, I'm a seasoned 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫 and 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫. My experience as a Scrum Master in the scholarship program has taught me the value of collaboration and fostering team success. As a Java/Spring Boot instructor, I excel at explaining complex concepts in a clear and engaging way. These experiences have instilled in me a strong foundation in 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩, and 𝐭𝐞𝐚𝐦𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐤, making me a valuable asset to any team.
